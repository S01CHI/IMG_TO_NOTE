＃IMG_TO_NOTE
This is the repository of "ImgToNote", an application that can recognize characters from images using Django and convert them into text data.
Unfortunately, the conversion function was still working on microsoft Azure, but it has expired and is no longer available. 
In addition, the email authentication function is currently being restored.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
